## Functionalities
Application features:
- Logging of sensor data:
  - Inertial sensors data such as accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, as well as software sensors data for linear acceleration, orientation (quaternions), gravity;
  - Environmental sensors data as temperature, light, pressure and humidity;
  - Positioning sensors data such as location and satellites;
  - Networks connectivity data, as network cells and WiFi networks;
  - Battery level
  - Microphone audio
  Every sensors can be configured in the settings to enable/disable it, set the sampling frequency, the remote upload of its data.
- Remote upload of data
- Multidevice (master-slaves) configuration
- Bluetooth connection for synchronization among device of time and status (logging/no logging, labels, sublabels)
- Autostart at boot/reboot
- Background logging using persistent notification
- Logging of data on files (a new file is created at regular interval to reduce data loss)

## Configuration required 
### Settings' password
In order to prevent changes to the setting by the users, the setting menu is protected by a password. It is recommended to change the password in the code before to deploy the application. Set the value of `ADMIN_CODE` in `Constants.java` to change the password before to install the application.

### Master & Slave configuration
It can be configured for collecting data on multiple devices synchronously, in a master-slave configuration. The configuration is set changing the position of the device in the settings. The Hand device is the master, while Hips, Torso and Bag device are the slaves.

### Remote upload
The remote upload functionality requires to set up the remote address for the upload. The address is in `string.xml` in the value folder.
